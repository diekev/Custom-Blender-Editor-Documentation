To-do's
-------

- Allow setting a category for the custom spaces
- Fully replace usage of enum values with idnames.
- Expose grid view (e.g. spreadsheet) and tree view (e.g. outliner) widgets to the API
- Drag & drop support (hard)
- Better UIList widget, with multiple selection support (possibly via a new type)

Known Issues
------------

- Saving a file with multiple custom editors after unregistering one of them messes up the data.
