To-do's
-------

- Allow setting a category for the custom spaces
- Add a proper base structure for SpaceLink.
- Replace usage of enum values with idnames where it matters (e.g. for setting space types)
    - [ ] bAnimContext.spacetype
    - [x] ScrArea.spacetype
    - [x] ScrArea.butspacetype
    - [x] SpaceLink.spacetype
    - [ ] TransInfo.spacetype
    - [x] wmKeyMap.spaceid
- Expose grid view (e.g. spreadsheet) and tree view (e.g. outliner) widgets to the API
- Drag & drop support (hard)
- Better UIList widget, with multiple selection support (possibly via a new type)
- Move specific space behaviors to callbacks in SpaceType.
    - Grease Pencil
    - Color Management
- Expose Region/View2D/etc. properties to the RNA.

Known Issues
------------

- Opening a file containing an unregistered custom editor changes its type to that of the Info Editor (dev note: because area->spacedata.first is NULL when reading the blend file; behavior comes from version 2.5).
